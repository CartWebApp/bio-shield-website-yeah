            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                At Bioshield, we believe in protecting what matters most—your family, your health, and the environment. 
                Our journey began with a simple idea: to create an insect repellent that is not only effective but also safe for people of all backgrounds and gentle on the planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inspired by the rich diversity of ecosystems around the world, we set out to craft a product that works in harmony with nature. 
                From the dense rainforests to the sunlit meadows, every ingredient we use is thoughtfully sourced to ensure sustainability and respect for the environment.

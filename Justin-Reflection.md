# Project Bioshield Reflection
## Main Programming and Design Process
When developing the basic structure of the website, the process began with adding the basics: HTML files and CSS files. Then, to figure out what to put on those pages, we had to look at other websites to take inspiration from while also forming new ideas to put on our website. Like what we previously learned, we made sure to take account into good website design and what we learned about semantic tags. 
## Use of AI Tools
In creation of this website, AI tools played a significant role.
1. Planning and Ideation: We used AI to brainstorm other insect repellent websites as well as what values they have to offer and what type of language they use to persuade their audience into buying their products, looking at the bigger companies as well as the smaller ones.
2. Content Generation: AI assisted in creating statements for product descriptions and mainly generating images of the product. We used Github Copilot to generate the product descriptions, and we used Microsoft Copilot to generate the images of our product. Though, AI did not assist in images with our product being shown; they were edited.
3. Code Assistance: AI was very useful for coding because we did not have the complete knowledge on how to code CSS to its fullest potential as well as Javascript. We used Github Copilot mainly to helped with creating a lot of sections such as the index page, the about page, the product page, and the contact page, along with their needed CSS for styling. Specifically, AI helped with creating the basic structure for each page and mainly helped with tweaking the CSS and where to place the images.
